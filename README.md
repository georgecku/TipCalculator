#Pre-work - TipCalculator

TipCalculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: George Ku

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Allowed user to enter amount to split the check between x amount of people 
  (x>=1). If value entered is not >=1, value is automatically changed to 1

## Notes

Took a while to get used to controlling elements in the storyboard, but once that was taken care of, everything got a lot easier.
